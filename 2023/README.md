# 2023

AoC 2023! This year, following the setup of [Chris Biscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/rust), I'm automating things with the `just` cli tool.
To run benchmarks on your device for this, make sure to:
1. Install rust at [rustup.rs](rustup.rs)
2. Install just with `cargo install just` or `brew install just` on macos
3. `just benchmark-all`
4. See the output in the `benchmarks.txt` file!
