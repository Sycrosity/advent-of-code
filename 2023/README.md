# 2023

AoC 2023! This year, following the setup of [Chris Biscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/rust), I'm automating things with the `just` cli tool, a make-like recipe runner.
To run benchmarks on your device for this, make sure to:
1. Install rust at [rustup.rs](rustup.rs)
2. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/Sycrosity/advent-of-code` and `cd 2023`
4. Install [just](https://just.systems/) by running `cargo install just` (or `brew install just` on macos)
5. Run `just benchmark-all`
6. See the output in the `benchmarks.txt` file!
